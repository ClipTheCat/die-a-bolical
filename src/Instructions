The Game

  The goal of the game is to have at least 1 person alive when you run out of moves, or kill every 
  zombie. You lose when all people are zombies or dead. 
  
  Zombies have a 30% chance to infect a random living person each turn. 
  
  There is 1 secret zombie at the beginning of the game. They act and look exactly like a living
  person, but infect living people twice as often. They are revealed at the end of the game.

Actions

  quarantine [target] [executer]
    (Requires a living person to execute)
    Quarantines a person. If they are a zombie, this will freeze them for 1 turn. If they are
    living, they can not be infected for 1 turn.
    Fail: 30%, and if the target is a zombie the executer will be infected.  
  
  kill [target] [executer]
    (Requires a living person to execute)
    Kills a person, taking them out of the game permanently. 
    Fail: 0% 
    Side effect: If the target is a zombie, there is a 30% chance the executer will be infected.  
    
  question [target (living)] 
    Gets a person's list of individuals they are suspicious of. 
    Each person has a 30% chance to be suspicious of another real living person and a 60% chance to 
    be suspicious of the secret zombie. These are constant and are determined when the game starts.
