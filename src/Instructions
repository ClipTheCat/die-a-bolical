The Game

  There is 1 secret zombie at the beginning of the game. They act and look exactly like a living
  person, but have a 20% chance to infect a random living person each turn. They are revealed when
  killed.

  The goal of the game is to have at least 1 person alive when you run out of moves, or kill every 
  zombie. You lose when all people are zombies or dead.
